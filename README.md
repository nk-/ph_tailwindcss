### Ph* TailwindCSS Drupal 10 theme.
See it in action here: https://ph-playground.store
A front page there is the actual documentation for it.

#### Wanna try? On the existing Drupal site?
- Note, this is rather a _proof-of-concept_ and originally not intended for a general usage, as contributed Drupal theme. However, it may serve as a starter kit or ideas and solutions source. 
- Clone this repository and take _Ph* core_ module and _Ph* Tailwind CSS_ theme and place in appropriate directories.
- Enable module and theme and start playing, either with Twig templates or with Tailwind's Post CSS file found in src folder within theme.
- To build distribution CSS file run: `npm run build` from within theme folder.
